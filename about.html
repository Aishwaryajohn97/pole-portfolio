    <h2>Aishwarya John Pole</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Aishwarya</strong>, a self-driven and detail-oriented web and POS system developer based in <strong>Ilford, UK</strong>. I specialize in building visually appealing, functional, and responsive websites and software solutions that empower small businesses across the globe.</p>

    <p>Over the last few years, I’ve helped businesses in the UK, Ghana, and beyond establish a strong online presence and streamline their operations through customized Point of Sale (POS) systems. Whether you're just getting started or looking to upgrade your current setup, I provide tailored solutions that are both cost-effective and impactful.</p>

    <h3>My Mission</h3>
    <p>My mission is simple — to help entrepreneurs and small business owners bring their vision to life online, without the usual stress or high cost. I believe technology should be accessible, intuitive, and built around your real-world needs.</p>

    <h3> What I Can Build For You</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Websites:</strong> Full-featured websites with services, contact forms, product pages, and mobile responsiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio Sites:</strong> Clean and professional portfolios for creatives, freelancers, and individuals showcasing their work.</li>
      <li><strong>IT/Corporate Sites:</strong> Designed for companies offering technology services, with career pages, inquiry forms, and structured navigation.</li>
      <li><strong>POS Systems:</strong> Lightweight and effective sales systems that work locally or online — includes sales tracking, invoicing, and reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting Support:</strong> I help you get set up on platforms like GoDaddy, Vercel, or Namecheap, and make your site live with a custom domain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Why Clients Trust Me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You work directly with me — I handle your project from start to finish with personal attention.</li>
      <li>I offer transparent pricing, no surprises, and flexible support options.</li>
      <li>My work is clean, reliable, and built to scale with your business needs.</li>
      <li>I prioritize simplicity and usability — both for you and your customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Available Worldwide</h3>
    <p>Whether you're based in London, Accra, New York, or Nairobi — I can work with you remotely. Communication is seamless, timelines are clear, and your success is my top priority.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for someone who understands both the creative and technical sides of building websites and systems, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s turn your ideas into a working reality.</p>
