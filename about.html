      <h2>Aishwarya John Pole</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Aishwarya</strong>, a self-driven and detail-oriented web and POS system developer based in <strong>Ilford, UK</strong>. I specialize in building visually appealing, functional, and responsive websites and software solutions that empower small businesses across the globe.</p>

      <p>Over the last few years, I’ve helped businesses in the UK, Ghana, and beyond establish a strong online presence and streamline their operations through customized Point of Sale (POS) systems. Whether you're just getting started or looking to upgrade your current setup, I provide tailored solutions that are both cost-effective and impactful.</p>

      <h3>💼 My Mission</h3>
      <p>My mission is simple — to help entrepreneurs and small business owners bring their vision to life online, without the usual stress or high cost. I believe technology should be accessible, intuitive, and built around your real-world needs.</p>

      <h3>🛠 What I Can Build For You</h3>

        <li><strong>POS Systems:</strong> Lightweight and effective sales systems that work locally or online — includes sales tracking, invoicing, and reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting Support:</strong> I help you get set up on platforms like GoDaddy, Vercel, or Namecheap, and make your site live with a custom domain.</li>
      </ul>
